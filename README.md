# ***DNT NOTICE***
Some of the features of this plugin require DNT Opt Ins. 
To accomplish this, the players will be shown a dnt opt in notification when using the command. 
They must accept by typing the command followed by DNTCONFIRM to accept.

When data is stored for opting players with DNT, ***identifying features will be one-way encrypted (hashed) before being stored***. (User Id)

### Alternatively, you can disable DNT features in the config, if you feel that it suites your server better.

Features that use DNT Opt In:
- Scp 3114 Preference Selection

Make sure you are aware of the Verified Server Rules (VSR) and are capable of following them.
